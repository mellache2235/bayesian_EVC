## Short Answer: NO! EVC is Still Highly Active and Evolving

**But** the field is moving toward incorporating uncertainty and temporal dynamics - **which is exactly what you're doing!**

## Recent Extensions to EVC (2020-2024)

### **1. Uncertainty-Based EVC**

**Your approach fits here!**

Recent work shows:
- Uncertainty modulates control allocation
- People increase control when uncertain
- Individual differences in uncertainty sensitivity

**Key papers:**
- Bayesian models of flexible cognitive control (2020)
- Trial-to-trial uncertainty adjustments (2021)
- Dynamic conflict resolution (2022)

**Your contribution:** Explicit uncertainty weight (λ) in EVC formula

---

### **2. Temporal/Dynamic EVC**

**Within-trial dynamics:**
- Control isn't static - it evolves during a trial
- Attention fluctuates moment-to-moment
- Need dynamic models

**Cross-trial dynamics:**
- Control depends on trial history
- Adaptive learning from outcomes
- Your temporal extension addresses this!

---

### **3. Metacognitive EVC**

**Confidence and monitoring:**
- Control allocation depends on confidence
- Metacognitive awareness moderates control
- Error monitoring feeds back to control

**Connection to your work:**
- Confidence = inverse uncertainty
- Your uncertainty weight captures metacognitive sensitivity

---

### **4. Computational Psychiatry Applications**

**Clinical extensions:**
- EVC parameters differ in psychiatric conditions
- Abnormal cost-benefit computations
- Individual differences in control allocation

**Your contribution:**
- λ parameter as clinical biomarker
- Abnormal uncertainty processing → symptoms

---

## Alternative/Complementary Frameworks

### **1. Active Inference / Free Energy**

**Framework:** (Friston, 2010+)
```
Action = minimize(Free_Energy)
Free_Energy = Prediction_Error + Uncertainty
```

**How it relates to EVC:**
- Both are cost-benefit frameworks
- Free energy = generalization of EVC
- Active inference = control to reduce uncertainty

**Status:** Very active, especially in computational psychiatry

**Your work bridges both:** EVC structure + uncertainty reduction

---

### **2. Predictive Coding**

**Framework:**
```
Perception = top-down prediction + bottom-up prediction error
Control = adjusting predictions to minimize errors
```

**How it relates to EVC:**
- Both involve prediction and error
- Predictive coding focuses on perception
- EVC focuses on control allocation

**Status:** Very active in computational neuroscience

---

### **3. Resource-Rational Models**

**Framework:** (Lieder & Griffiths, 2020)
```
Optimal computation under resource constraints
Control = optimal allocation of limited cognitive resources
```

**How it relates to EVC:**
- Very similar philosophy
- More emphasis on computational limits
- Less emphasis on neural mechanisms

**Status:** Growing, especially in AI

---

### **4. Meta-Learning / Learning-to-Learn**

**Framework:**
```
Learn not just task, but how to learn
Meta-parameters control learning rates
Adapt to environmental statistics
```

**How it relates to EVC:**
- HGF is a meta-learning model
- Control allocation could be meta-learned
- Your volatility weight connects to this

**Status:** Very hot in AI and neuroscience

## What Your Labmate is Likely Doing

### **"Using Bayesian principles, entropy, drift rate, and something else for trial-by-trial uncertainty"**

This sounds like:

### **Approach 1: DDM + Entropy (Most Likely)**

```python
# Drift Diffusion Model for each trial
for trial in trials:
    # Fit DDM to get drift rate
    v = estimate_drift_rate(rt, choice, accuracy)
    
    # Drift rate → confidence
    confidence = f(v)  # High drift = high confidence
    
    # Confidence → entropy (uncertainty)
    if binary_choice:
        p = confidence
        entropy = -p*log(p) - (1-p)*log(1-p)
    
    # Entropy = trial-by-trial uncertainty measure
```

**What this measures:**
- **Drift rate (v)**: Evidence strength (from DDM fit to RT/accuracy)
- **Entropy**: Uncertainty in choice probability
- **"Something else"**: Possibly boundary separation (cautiousness) or non-decision time

**How it relates to your work:**
- They estimate uncertainty from RT/choice patterns
- You use uncertainty to predict control
- **Complementary!** You could collaborate!

---

### **Approach 2: Bayesian Confidence Model**

```python
# Bayesian posterior over choices
for trial in trials:
    # Compute posterior probability of each choice
    posterior = bayesian_inference(evidence, prior)
    
    # Entropy of posterior = uncertainty
    entropy = -sum(p * log(p) for p in posterior)
    
    # Drift rate equivalent
    drift_analog = posterior[correct_choice] - 0.5
    
    # Confidence
    confidence = max(posterior)
```

**Measures:**
- **Posterior entropy**: Uncertainty in belief
- **Drift rate analog**: Strength of evidence
- **Confidence**: Probability of being correct

---

### **Approach 3: Information Theory Approach**

```python
# Trial-by-trial information metrics

for trial in trials:
    # Entropy (uncertainty before choice)
    H_before = entropy(prior)
    
    # Entropy after observing evidence
    H_after = entropy(posterior)
    
    # Information gain
    IG = H_before - H_after
    
    # Drift rate (rate of information gain)
    drift_rate = IG / reaction_time
```

**Measures:**
- **Entropy**: Uncertainty at different stages
- **Information gain**: How much learned
- **Drift rate**: Speed of learning

control = bayesian_evc.predict(reward, accuracy, uncertainty)
```

## Recommendation: How to Position Your Work

### **Your Contribution:**

> "We extend the Expected Value of Control framework - a foundational model of cognitive control allocation - to incorporate Bayesian uncertainty estimation. This addresses a recognized limitation in traditional EVC: it doesn't account for how uncertainty influences control decisions. Our Bayesian EVC model explicitly models uncertainty reduction as a control benefit, providing a more complete account of adaptive control allocation."

### **Key Framing Points:**

1. ✅ **Building on EVC** (not replacing it)
2. ✅ **Addressing current frontier** (uncertainty)
3. ✅ **Aligned with trends** (Bayesian, temporal, clinical)
4. ✅ **Novel contribution** (explicit λ parameter)

## What to Tell People

### **When presenting your work:**

> "The Expected Value of Control (EVC) is a foundational framework for understanding cognitive control allocation, with over 2000 citations and ongoing research. However, traditional EVC doesn't account for uncertainty - a recognized limitation. We address this gap by extending EVC with Bayesian uncertainty estimation, providing a more complete model of adaptive control. This extension aligns with current trends in computational neuroscience toward uncertainty-aware models while maintaining the interpretability and neural grounding of the EVC framework."
