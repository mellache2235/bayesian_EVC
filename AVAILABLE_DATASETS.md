})

# Create control proxy
data['control_proxy'] = normalize(data['rt'])

# Infer uncertainty if not available
if 'confidence' not in data.columns:

    data = hgf.process_subject_data(
        data,
        subject_col='subject_id',

# Fit Bayesian EVC
model = BayesianEVC()
results = model.fit(
    data,
    observed_control_col='control_proxy',
