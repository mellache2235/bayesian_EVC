Executive functioning (EF) involves environment-specific cost-benefit computations about how much cognitive effort is worth applying. Because everyday tasks and environments are dynamic and have element unknown to us, an important factor shaping these computations is uncertainty. This includes uncertainty about the current state, rules to follow, and feedback to guide actions.
The Expected Value of Control (EVC) theory, developed to model how the brain decides when and how much cognitive effort to allocate, has been widely applied in cognitive neuroscience. Traditionally, EVC models have emphasized reward and effort costs but often assume clear and stable task conditions. These don’t properly reflect the uncertainty individuals experience while performing tasks. By not taking uncertainty into account, we assume our mental processes are strictly deterministic without any element of being unsure.
To address this limitation, my project integrates Bayesian principles into the EVC framework. Specifically, I propose a EVC model which weighs value assignment with confidence, where determining control allocation is factored in with an individual's moment-to-moment uncertainty and confidence levels. The Bayesian approach provides estimates of confidence that better ground EVC benefit and captures how effort allocation is influenced by the desire for reducing uncertainty. *** In traditional EVC/DDM approaches, decisions are typically modeled based solely on balancing rewards against effort costs. This approach explicitly incorporates uncertainty into the EVC calculation, adding a direct "uncertainty reduction benefit" to the model. This means the value of exerting control is explicitly scaled by uncertainty reduction—participants explicitly allocate control not only to gain rewards, but to reduce uncertainty about rules and evidence. ***
Uncertainty can be computed in two clear ways. Decision uncertainty can be measured from trial-to-trial variability in evidence clarity or task difficulty. Building upon approaches such as drift diffusion models can allow for confidence estimation based on the likelihood of a correct response on each trial. More ambiguous trials yield higher uncertainty, which can be reduced by investing additional cognitive control. *** While traditional DDM approaches implicitly represent uncertainty via reaction times and drift rates, my proposal explicitly quantifies and incorporates Bayesian uncertainty about rules and evidence clarity into the EVC calculation—directly modeling how participants strategically deploy control to reduce uncertainty, capturing individual differences in uncertainty tolerance, and providing novel predictions about neural signatures of uncertainty-sensitive cognitive control ***
Second, state or rule uncertainty reflects the uncertainty about task conditions, such as rules or strategies that are ambiguous or might change unexpectedly. Bayesian models allow for estimation of participants' beliefs about the current task rules, providing trial-level estimates of uncertainty. Investing additional cognitive effort can reduce this uncertainty by gathering clearer evidence.
I hypothesize that incorporating this Bayesian uncertainty estimation significantly enhances the predictive and explanatory power of the EVC model. It allows the model to better capture realistic scenarios where uncertainty about rules or evidence fluctuates within tasks. Without this Bayesian component, traditional EVC models fail to account fully for increased control allocation during volatile or ambiguous situations. Bayesian estimation allows better identification of individual differences, clarifying how children vary in their tolerance and responses to uncertainty. Implementing Bayesian statistics can introduce certain methodological challenges, such as increased computational complexity and potential difficulties in parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we can consider alternative inference methods, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or simplified Bayesian approximations, ensuring robust and reliable parameter estimates. 
We can vary task clarity (evidence uncertainty) and rule stability (state uncertainty) within validated EF tasks, then test if this uncertainty-aware EVC model better predicts children's behavioral data and neural activity (fNIRS,fMRI) compared to non-Bayesian EVC models.
