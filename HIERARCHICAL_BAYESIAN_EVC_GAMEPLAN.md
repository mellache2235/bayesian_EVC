# Hierarchical Bayesian EVC: Project Gameplan

## Background and Motivation

Executive functioning (EF) involves environment-specific cost-benefit computations about how much cognitive effort is worth applying. Because everyday tasks and environments are dynamic and have element unknown to us, an important factor shaping these computations is uncertainty. This includes uncertainty about the current state, rules to follow, and feedback to guide actions.

The Expected Value of Control (EVC) theory, developed to model how the brain decides when and how much cognitive effort to allocate, has been widely applied in cognitive neuroscience. Traditionally, EVC models have emphasized reward and effort costs but often assume clear and stable task conditions. These don't properly reflect the uncertainty individuals experience while performing tasks. By not taking uncertainty into account, we assume our mental processes are strictly deterministic without any element of being unsure.

To address this limitation, my project integrates Bayesian principles into the EVC framework. Specifically, I propose a EVC model which weighs value assignment with confidence, where determining control allocation is factored in with an individual's moment-to-moment uncertainty and confidence levels. The Bayesian approach provides estimates of confidence that better ground EVC benefit and captures how effort allocation is influenced by the desire for reducing uncertainty.

Uncertainty can be computed in two clear ways. Decision uncertainty can be measured from trial-to-trial variability in evidence clarity or task difficulty. Building upon approaches such as drift diffusion models can allow for confidence estimation based on the likelihood of a correct response on each trial. More ambiguous trials yield higher uncertainty, which can be reduced by investing additional cognitive control.

Second, state or rule uncertainty reflects the uncertainty about task conditions, such as rules or strategies that are ambiguous or might change unexpectedly. Bayesian models allow for estimation of participants' beliefs about the current task rules to follow, and feedback to guide actions. Investing additional cognitive effort can reduce this uncertainty by gathering clearer evidence.

I hypothesize that incorporating this Bayesian uncertainty estimation significantly enhances the predictive and explanatory power of the EVC model. It allows the model to better capture realistic scenarios where uncertainty about rules or evidence fluctuates within tasks. Without this Bayesian component, traditional EVC models fail to account fully for increased control allocation during volatile or ambiguous situations. Bayesian estimation allows better identification or individual differences, clarifying how children vary in their tolerance and response to uncertainty. Implementing Bayesian statistics can introduce certain methodological challenges, such as increased computational complexity and potential difficulties in parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we can consider alternative inference methods, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of simplified Bayesian approximations, ensuring robust and reliable parameter estimates.

We can vary task clarity (evidence uncertainty) and rule stability (state uncertainty) within validated EF tasks, then test if this uncertainty-aware EVC model better predicts children's behavioral data and neural activity (fNIRS,fMRI) compared to non-Bayesian EVC models.

## The Hierarchical Bayesian Advantage for Small Sample Sizes

A critical challenge in cognitive neuroscience research, particularly in developmental and clinical populations, is working with limited sample sizes. Typical in-house studies can realistically recruit 15-30 participants, with 100-200 trials per participant. Traditional pooled models that estimate a single set of parameters across all participants ignore meaningful individual differences and often fail to generalize to new individuals. Conversely, fitting completely separate models for each participant with only 100-200 trials leads to unstable, unreliable parameter estimates with high uncertainty.

Hierarchical Bayesian modeling solves this dilemma through partial pooling—a principled compromise between complete pooling (treating everyone identically) and no pooling (treating everyone as entirely independent). In hierarchical models, individual-level parameters are constrained by population-level distributions. This means that when data for a particular participant is limited or noisy, their parameter estimates are naturally "shrunk" toward the group mean, stabilizing the estimates. Meanwhile, participants with more informative data retain estimates closer to their individual fits. This shrinkage is not arbitrary; it emerges automatically from the Bayesian framework based on the relative precision of individual versus group-level information.

For our uncertainty weight parameter (λ), hierarchical Bayesian estimation provides several key advantages. First, we obtain population-level inference: we can estimate the typical uncertainty sensitivity in children (μ_λ) and quantify how much children vary in this sensitivity (σ_λ). Second, we obtain stable individual-level estimates (λᵢ for each child) even with modest trial counts, enabling us to identify which children show atypical patterns—for instance, those with unusually high λ who may be experiencing math anxiety. Third, we can make probabilistic statements such as "the probability that the population mean λ is greater than zero is 99.8%", providing strong evidence for our theoretical prediction. Finally, the hierarchical structure naturally accommodates missing data and unbalanced designs, making it robust to real-world data collection challenges.

This approach aligns with best practices in contemporary cognitive modeling and computational psychiatry. It maximizes statistical power with limited samples, provides both group-level scientific insight and individual-level clinical utility, and yields interpretable parameters that can guide theoretical understanding and practical interventions. Given the realistic constraints of developmental neuroscience research, hierarchical Bayesian modeling is not merely an option but the optimal methodological choice for testing our uncertainty-aware EVC framework.

## Risk Mitigation

### **Risk 1: Small sample size yields unstable estimates**

**Mitigation:**
- Use hierarchical Bayesian modeling (designed for small N)
- Partial pooling stabilizes individual estimates
- Power analysis confirms N=30 adequate for μ_λ
- Can always increase N if pilot shows need

**Contingency:** If N=30 insufficient, recruit additional 20 children

---

### **Risk 2: No uncertainty effect (λ ≈ 0)**

**Mitigation:**
- Simulation shows λ > 0 in realistic scenarios
- Prior literature suggests uncertainty matters
- Manipulation check: Vary difficulty to ensure uncertainty range

**Contingency:** Even if μ_λ ≈ 0, still publishable (negative result)
- "Uncertainty does NOT affect control in arithmetic tasks"
- Important theoretical contribution
- Clarifies boundary conditions of EVC

---

### **Risk 3: Model doesn't fit data well (R² < 0.10)**

**Mitigation:**
- Multiple model specifications tested
- Hierarchical model expected to improve fit substantially
- Validation with simulated data first

**Contingency:** 
- Add temporal dynamics (HGF) as Aim 3
- Integrate with HDDM for richer model
- Still learn about what predicts control (exploratory)

---

### **Risk 4: Computational/technical challenges**

**Mitigation:**
- PyMC has excellent documentation and community
- Statistical consultant budgeted for implementation
- Test on simulated data before real data
- Allow 3 months for model development

**Contingency:**
- Use simpler pooled model if hierarchical too difficult
- Collaborate with computational expert
- Extend timeline if needed
