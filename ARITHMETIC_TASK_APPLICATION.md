# Applying Bayesian EVC to Arithmetic Tasks in Children

## Overview

Your Bayesian EVC framework is **perfectly suited** for modeling cognitive control in arithmetic tasks! This application addresses:

1. ✅ **Varying problem difficulty** - Different uncertainty levels
2. ✅ **Learning from past trials** - Temporal dynamics via HGF
3. ✅ **Individual differences** - Children vary in math ability
4. ✅ **Cognitive control allocation** - Effort on hard vs. easy problems

---

## The Arithmetic Task Scenario

### **Typical Setup:**

```
Children (ages 7-12) solve arithmetic problems:
- Easy: 3 + 5 = ?
- Medium: 17 + 28 = ?
- Hard: 234 + 567 = ?

Measured:
- Reaction time (RT)
- Accuracy
- Confidence ratings (if available)
- Pupil dilation (if available)
```

### **Research Questions:**

1. **How does problem difficulty affect control allocation?**
   - Do children exert more control on harder problems?
   
2. **Does uncertainty from past performance affect current control?**
   - After getting several problems wrong, do they try harder?
   
3. **How do children learn to allocate control efficiently?**
   - Do they learn which problems need more effort?
   
4. **Individual differences in control allocation?**
   - Some children work hard on all problems (anxious?)
   - Others give up on hard problems (low persistence?)

## How Bayesian EVC Maps to Arithmetic Tasks

### **Traditional EVC Variables:**

| EVC Variable | Arithmetic Task Mapping |
|--------------|------------------------|
| **Reward** | Points/praise for correct answers |
| **Accuracy** | Probability of getting it right (depends on difficulty) |
| **Control** | Mental effort, working memory engagement |
| **Effort Cost** | Metabolic cost, cognitive fatigue |

### **Bayesian EVC Extensions:**

| Bayesian Variable | Arithmetic Task Mapping |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Decision Uncertainty** | How hard is this problem? (difficulty level) |
| **State Uncertainty** | Am I good at these problems? (confidence from past trials) |
| **Volatility** | Is my performance getting better/worse? (learning trajectory) |
| **Control (measured)** | RT, pupil dilation, strategy choice |

---

## Data Generation for Arithmetic Tasks

### **What We Need to Simulate:**

```python
For each child, each problem:
- Problem: "17 + 28 = ?"
- Difficulty: Easy/Medium/Hard (1-5 scale)
- Correct answer: 45
- Child's ability: Math skill level
- Past performance: Recent successes/failures
- Control allocated: Effort exerted
- Outcome: Correct/incorrect + RT
```

## Applying Bayesian EVC to Arithmetic Data

### **Model Specification:**

```python
# Traditional EVC
Control = (Reward × Expected_Accuracy - Cost(Control)) / (2 × Cost_Weight)

# Bayesian EVC for Arithmetic
Control = Baseline + 
          (Reward × Expected_Accuracy + λ × Uncertainty) / (2 × Cost_Weight)
          
Where:
- Reward = Points for problem (higher for harder problems)
- Expected_Accuracy = Child's estimated probability of success
- Uncertainty = Problem difficulty + self-doubt from past failures
- λ = Uncertainty weight (individual difference)
```

### **Temporal Component (HGF):**

```python
# Track child's belief about their own ability over time
HGF tracks:
- Belief about math ability (μ₂)
- Uncertainty about ability (σ₂²)
- Volatility in performance (μ₃)

After each trial:
- Success → belief increases, uncertainty decreases
- Failure → belief decreases, uncertainty increases
- Streak of failures → volatility increases → higher learning rate
```

print(f"Difference: t = {t:.2f}, p = {p:.4f}")
```

**Expected finding:** Higher control on harder problems (if λ > 0)

---

### **2. Does Past Performance Affect Current Control?**

**Analysis:**
```python
# Add "recent success rate" feature
data['recent_success'] = data.groupby('child_id')['correct'].rolling(
    window=5, min_periods=1
).mean().reset_index(0, drop=True)

# Correlation
corr = data['recent_success'].corr(data['control_signal'])
print(f"Correlation(recent_success, control): {corr:.3f}")

# Regression
import statsmodels.api as sm

X = sm.add_constant(data[['recent_success', 'difficulty']])
y = data['control_signal']
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

**Expected finding:** After failures, control increases (compensatory effort)

---

### **3. Individual Differences in Uncertainty Sensitivity?**

**Analysis:**
```python
# Fit Bayesian EVC per child, extract λ

lambdas = []
for child_id in data['child_id'].unique():
    child_data = data[data['child_id'] == child_id]
    
    # Fit model
    model = BayesianEVC()
    results = model.fit(child_data)
    
    lambdas.append({
        'child_id': child_id,
        'lambda': results['uncertainty_weight'],
        'age': child_data['age'].iloc[0],
        'ability': child_data['math_ability'].iloc[0]
    })

lambdas_df = pd.DataFrame(lambdas)

# Does λ correlate with age?
corr_age = lambdas_df['lambda'].corr(lambdas_df['age'])
print(f"Correlation(λ, age): {corr_age:.3f}")

# Does λ correlate with ability?
corr_ability = lambdas_df['lambda'].corr(lambdas_df['ability'])
print(f"Correlation(λ, ability): {corr_ability:.3f}")
```

**Potential findings:**
- Older children: Lower λ (less affected by uncertainty)
- Higher ability: Lower λ (more confident)
- Anxious children: Higher λ (over-respond to uncertainty)

---

### **4. Learning Trajectory: How Does Control Evolve?**

**Analysis:**
```python
# Fit temporal model
from models.bayesian_evc_temporal import BayesianEVC_Temporal

model = BayesianEVC_Temporal()
results = model.fit(data)

# Plot uncertainty evolution for one child
child_data = data[data['child_id'] == 0]
predictions, uncertainty_traj, volatility_traj = model.predict_control_sequential(
    child_data
)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(12, 8))

# Uncertainty over trials
axes[0].plot(uncertainty_traj)
axes[0].set_ylabel('Uncertainty about Ability')
axes[0].set_title('Child Learning: Uncertainty Decreases Over Trials')

# Control over trials
axes[1].plot(child_data['control_signal'].values, label='Observed')
axes[1].plot(predictions, label='Predicted', linestyle='--')
axes[1].set_xlabel('Trial')
axes[1].set_ylabel('Control')
axes[1].legend()
axes[1].set_title('Control Allocation: Predicted vs. Observed')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Expected finding:** Uncertainty decreases as child learns, control becomes more efficient

---

## Clinical/Educational Applications

### **1. Identifying Math Anxiety**

**High λ children:**
- Over-allocate control due to uncertainty
- Effortful even on easy problems
- May need anxiety intervention

```python
# Identify high-λ children
high_lambda = lambdas_df[lambdas_df['lambda'] > lambdas_df['lambda'].quantile(0.75)]
print(f"High uncertainty sensitivity children: {len(high_lambda)}")
print("These children may have math anxiety")
```

---

### **2. Personalized Difficulty Adjustment**

**Use model to select optimal difficulty:**

```python
def select_next_problem(child_model, child_state):
    """
    Select problem difficulty that maximizes learning
    
    Too easy: No challenge, no learning
    Too hard: High uncertainty, gives up
    Just right: Moderate uncertainty, optimal control
    """
    best_difficulty = None
    max_engagement = 0
    
    for difficulty in range(1, 6):
        # Simulate control for this difficulty
        predicted_control = child_model.predict(
            reward=difficulty * 10,
            uncertainty=estimate_uncertainty(difficulty, child_state)
        )
        
        # Engagement = high control but not too stressful
        engagement = predicted_control * (1 - stress_level(predicted_control))
        
        if engagement > max_engagement:
            max_engagement = engagement
            best_difficulty = difficulty
    
    return best_difficulty
```

---

### **3. Detecting Learning Plateaus**

**Use HGF volatility to detect when learning stalls:**

```python
# High volatility = inconsistent performance = struggling
struggling_periods = volatility_traj > volatility_traj.mean() + volatility_traj.std()

print(f"Trials where child is struggling: {np.where(struggling_periods)[0]}")
print("→ Provide intervention during these trials!")
```

## Expected Results

### **With Your Lab's Real Data:**

**Hypotheses:**

1. **H1: Uncertainty increases control**
   - Expected: λ > 0 (p < 0.001)
   - Children allocate more effort on uncertain problems

2. **H2: Past failures increase current control**
   - Expected: Positive correlation
   - Compensatory effort after mistakes

3. **H3: Older children more efficient**
   - Expected: Age negatively correlates with λ
   - Better calibration of control to difficulty

4. **H4: Individual differences in λ**
   - Expected: High variance in λ
   - Some children over-control (anxious?)
   - Some under-control (impulsive?)
