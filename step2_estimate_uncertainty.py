Step 2: Estimate Uncertainties Using Bayesian Methods

PURPOSE:
--------
This step processes behavioral data to add Bayesian uncertainty estimates.
It uses Bayesian inference to quantify two types of uncertainty:
1. Decision uncertainty (from evidence clarity)
2. State uncertainty (from belief updating about task rules)

WHAT THIS STEP DOES:
-------------------
1. Loads behavioral data created in Step 1
2. Initializes a Bayesian uncertainty estimator
3. Processes each trial sequentially using Bayesian inference
4. Estimates decision uncertainty from evidence clarity
5. Estimates state uncertainty from belief updating
6. Combines both types of uncertainty
7. Saves enhanced data with uncertainty measures

WHY THIS STEP MATTERS:
--------------------
- The original data has uncertainty measures, but this adds Bayesian estimates
- Bayesian uncertainty uses principled inference (Bayes' rule)
- Tracks how uncertainty evolves over trials
- Provides entropy-based uncertainty measures
- This step is OPTIONAL - you can skip it if using original uncertainty columns

KEY CONCEPTS:
------------
1. Decision Uncertainty: How uncertain you are about what the evidence means
   - Based on evidence_clarity (inverse relationship)
   - Higher evidence clarity → lower decision uncertainty
   - Measured using entropy: H = -Σ P(x) × log₂(P(x))

2. State Uncertainty: How uncertain you are about which task rule is active
   - Based on Bayesian belief updating over trials
   - Uses Bayes' rule: P(rule|observation) ∝ P(observation|rule) × P(rule)
   - Tracks beliefs about multiple possible task states
   - Measured using entropy of belief distribution

3. Combined Uncertainty: Integrated measure of both types
   - Typically: combined = 0.5 × decision + 0.5 × state
   - Provides overall uncertainty level for EVC calculations

OUTPUT FILES:
------------
- data/behavioral_data_with_uncertainties.csv: Original data + Bayesian uncertainty estimates

    # SequentialBayesianEstimator processes trials sequentially using Bayesian inference
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - n_states=2: Number of possible task states/rules
    #   Example: If task can have 2 rules (e.g., "respond to color" vs "respond to shape")
    #   This tells the estimator to track beliefs about 2 possible states
    #
    # - learning_rate=0.1: Rate of belief updating (0-1)
    #   - Higher learning_rate (e.g., 0.5): Beliefs update quickly with new evidence
    #   - Lower learning_rate (e.g., 0.1): Beliefs update slowly (more stable)
    #   - Formula: new_belief = (1 - α) × old_belief + α × posterior
    #   - α = learning_rate: how much to trust new observation
    #
    # What does the estimator do?
    # - Processes each trial sequentially
    # - Updates beliefs about task states using Bayes' rule
    # - Computes uncertainty measures (entropy-based)
    # - Tracks uncertainty evolution over time

    # 1. Groups data by subject (each subject's trials are processed separately)
    # 2. For each subject, resets beliefs at the start
    # 3. Processes trials sequentially:
    #    - Estimates decision uncertainty from evidence_clarity
    #    - Updates state beliefs using Bayesian inference
    #    - Estimates state uncertainty from belief distribution
    #    - Combines both uncertainties
    # 4. Returns enhanced data with new uncertainty columns
