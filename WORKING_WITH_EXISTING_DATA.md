# Working with Existing Datasets

## The Challenge

Your Bayesian EVC models require:
1. **Control** (often not directly measured)
2. **Uncertainty** (rarely explicitly measured)
3. Reward magnitude (usually available)
4. Accuracy (usually available)

**Question:** Can you test your theory without collecting new data?

**Answer:** YES! With some creativity and assumptions.

---

## Solution 1: Use Proxies for Missing Variables

### **A. Control Proxies**

#### **Option 1A: Reaction Time as Control Proxy**

**Assumption:** Slower RT = more control (deliberation)

```python
# Load existing dataset
data = pd.read_csv('existing_study.csv')

# Use RT as control proxy
data['control_proxy'] = normalize(data['rt'])

# Or inverse (faster = more control for some tasks)
data['control_proxy'] = normalize(-data['rt'])  # Negative so higher = more control

# Fit models
trad_model.fit(data, observed_control_col='control_proxy', ...)
```

**When this works:**
- Tasks where deliberation helps (e.g., difficult decisions)
- Stroop, flanker, go/no-go tasks
- Cognitive control paradigms

**When this fails:**
- Speed-accuracy tradeoff tasks
- Tasks where control speeds up responses (e.g., prepared responses)

---

#### **Option 1B: Accuracy as Control Proxy**

**Assumption:** Higher accuracy = more control invested

```python
# Use accuracy as control proxy
data['control_proxy'] = data['accuracy']

# Or trial-by-trial accuracy (0/1)
# Smooth it with running average
data['control_proxy'] = data['accuracy'].rolling(window=10, center=True).mean()
```

**When this works:**
- Tasks with clear accuracy measure
- Difficulty varies across trials
- Control directly improves performance

**When this fails:**
- Ceiling effects (everyone gets 100%)
- Floor effects (too hard)
- Accuracy depends more on stimulus than control

---

#### **Option 1C: Composite Control Measure (Best!)**

**Combine multiple proxies:**

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Prepare proxies
scaler = StandardScaler()
proxies = scaler.fit_transform(data[[
    'rt',                    # Reaction time
    'accuracy',              # Trial accuracy
    'error_rate',            # Error rate (if available)
    'response_variability'   # RT variability (if available)
]])

# Extract first principal component
pca = PCA(n_components=1)
data['control_proxy'] = pca.fit_transform(proxies).flatten()

print(f"Control proxy explains {pca.explained_variance_ratio_[0]:.1%} of variance")
```

**Advantages:**
- More robust than single proxy
- Captures multiple aspects of control
- Less sensitive to measurement noise

---

#### **Option 1D: Neural Activity as Control (If Available)**

**If dataset has fMRI/EEG:**

```python
# Use DLPFC activity as control proxy
data['control_proxy'] = normalize(data['dlpfc_bold'])

# Or ACC activity
data['control_proxy'] = normalize(data['acc_bold'])

# Or composite neural measure
data['control_proxy'] = (
    0.5 * normalize(data['dlpfc_bold']) +
    0.5 * normalize(data['acc_bold'])
)
```

**Gold standard if available!**

---

### **B. Uncertainty Proxies**

#### **Option 2A: Infer from Confidence Ratings**

**If dataset has confidence ratings:**

```python
# Uncertainty = inverse of confidence
data['uncertainty_proxy'] = 1 - normalize(data['confidence'])

# Or use confidence directly (scale to 0-1)
data['uncertainty_proxy'] = 1 - (data['confidence'] / data['confidence'].max())
```

**When this works:**
- Participants gave confidence ratings
- Confidence is well-calibrated
- Metacognitive awareness is good

---

#### **Option 2B: Infer from RT Variability**

**Assumption:** More variable RT = more uncertain

```python
# Compute RT variability per subject/condition
data['rt_std'] = data.groupby(['subject_id', 'condition'])['rt'].transform('std')
data['uncertainty_proxy'] = normalize(data['rt_std'])

# Or trial-by-trial variability (rolling window)
data['uncertainty_proxy'] = data.groupby('subject_id')['rt'].transform(
    lambda x: x.rolling(window=10, center=True).std()
)
```

---

#### **Option 2C: Use HGF to Infer Uncertainty (Recommended!)**

**Infer uncertainty from trial outcomes:**

```python
from models.hgf_uncertainty import HGFSequentialEstimator

# Initialize HGF
hgf = HGFSequentialEstimator(
    kappa_2=1.0,
    omega_2=-4.0,
    omega_3=-6.0
)

# Process data to infer uncertainty
data_with_uncertainty = hgf.process_subject_data(
    data,
    subject_col='subject_id',
    outcome_col='accuracy'  # Use trial outcomes
)

# Now have:
# - state_uncertainty: Uncertainty about task state
# - volatility: Estimated environmental volatility
# - learning_rate: Trial-by-trial learning rate
```

**Advantages:**
- Principled Bayesian inference
- No need for explicit uncertainty measure
- Captures trial-by-trial dynamics
- Estimates volatility automatically

**This is the best option if you don't have confidence ratings!**

---

#### **Option 2D: Task-Based Uncertainty**

**Use task design to define uncertainty:**

```python
# If task has blocks with different volatility
data['uncertainty_proxy'] = data['block'].map({
    'stable': 0.2,      # Low uncertainty block
    'volatile': 0.8     # High uncertainty block
})

# Or based on trial history
# High uncertainty after rule changes
data['trials_since_change'] = ...  # Compute from task structure
data['uncertainty_proxy'] = np.exp(-data['trials_since_change'] / 10)

# Or based on stimulus ambiguity
data['uncertainty_proxy'] = 1 - data['stimulus_clarity']
```

**When this works:**
- Task explicitly manipulates uncertainty
- Clear block structure
- Known rule changes

---

## Solution 2: Partial Model Testing

### **Test What You Can with Available Data**

#### **Scenario A: Have Control, Missing Uncertainty**

```python
# Test Traditional EVC only
trad_model = TraditionalEVC()
results = trad_model.fit(data, observed_control_col='control_proxy', ...)

print(f"Traditional EVC R²: {results['r2']:.3f}")
print(f"Reward weight: {results['reward_weight']:.3f}")

# Interpretation: Does reward and accuracy predict control?
```

**What you learn:**
- Whether basic EVC framework works
- Parameter estimates for reward/effort sensitivity
- Baseline for comparison

---

#### **Scenario B: Have Uncertainty, Missing Control**

```python
# Can't fit EVC directly, but can test correlations

# Does uncertainty correlate with behavioral measures?
corr_rt = data['uncertainty_proxy'].corr(data['rt'])
corr_acc = data['uncertainty_proxy'].corr(data['accuracy'])

print(f"Uncertainty-RT correlation: {corr_rt:.3f}")
print(f"Uncertainty-Accuracy correlation: {corr_acc:.3f}")

# Regression: Does uncertainty predict behavior?
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = data[['reward', 'uncertainty_proxy']].values
y = data['rt'].values

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

print(f"Uncertainty coefficient: {model.coef_[1]:.3f}")
```

**What you learn:**
- Whether uncertainty matters for behavior
- Preliminary evidence for Bayesian EVC
- Motivation for full study

---

## Solution 3: Leverage Existing Datasets Creatively

### **A. Meta-Analysis Approach**

**Combine multiple existing datasets:**

```python
# Dataset 1: Has RT and accuracy
dataset1 = load_dataset1()
dataset1['control_proxy'] = normalize(dataset1['rt'])

# Dataset 2: Has neural activity
dataset2 = load_dataset2()
dataset2['control_proxy'] = normalize(dataset2['dlpfc_bold'])

# Dataset 3: Has confidence ratings
dataset3 = load_dataset3()
dataset3['uncertainty_proxy'] = 1 - dataset3['confidence']

# Fit models on each
results = []
for data in [dataset1, dataset2, dataset3]:
    if 'control_proxy' in data.columns:
        result = fit_model(data)
        results.append(result)

# Meta-analyze
mean_r2 = np.mean([r['r2'] for r in results])
print(f"Meta-analytic R²: {mean_r2:.3f}")
```

---

### **B. Re-analyze Published Data**

**Many papers share data openly:**

```python
# Example: Stroop task dataset from OpenNeuro
# Has: RT, accuracy, fMRI (DLPFC, ACC)

# Extract control from DLPFC
control = normalize(fmri_data['dlpfc_bold'])

# Infer uncertainty from ACC
uncertainty = normalize(fmri_data['acc_bold'])

# Define reward (Stroop: correct = reward)
reward = fmri_data['accuracy']

# Fit Bayesian EVC
bayes_model.fit(
    fmri_data,
    observed_control_col='dlpfc_bold',
    uncertainty_col='acc_bold',
    reward_col='accuracy'
)
```

**Good sources:**
- OpenNeuro (fMRI datasets)
- OSF (Open Science Framework)
- Journal supplementary materials
- Author data sharing

---

### **C. Simulation-Guided Analysis**

**Use simulation to validate proxy approach:**

```python
# Step 1: Generate data with known control and uncertainty
sim_data = generate_simulation()

# Step 2: Test if RT proxy recovers true control
control_true = sim_data['control_signal']
control_proxy = normalize(sim_data['rt'])

correlation = np.corrcoef(control_true, control_proxy)[0, 1]
print(f"RT proxy correlation with true control: {correlation:.3f}")

# Step 3: If correlation is good (>0.5), use RT proxy on real data
if correlation > 0.5:
    print("✓ RT is valid control proxy for this task!")
    # Apply to real data
    real_data['control_proxy'] = normalize(real_data['rt'])
```

---

## Solution 4: Minimal Data Collection

### **Add-On Study to Existing Paradigm**

**Collect ONLY the missing measures:**

#### **Option A: Online Confidence Ratings**

```python
# Existing task: Stroop (has RT, accuracy)
# Add: Confidence rating after each trial

# Minimal addition:
for trial in trials:
    # Existing
    response = show_stroop_stimulus()
    rt = measure_rt()
    accuracy = check_accuracy(response)
    
    # NEW: Add confidence rating (1 second)
    confidence = ask_confidence()  # "How confident? 1-5"
    
    # Now have uncertainty proxy!
    uncertainty = 1 - confidence
```

**Cost:** +1 second per trial, minimal burden

---

#### **Option B: Pupillometry Add-On**

```python
# Existing task: Any cognitive task
# Add: Eye tracker (pupil dilation)

# Pupil dilation = cognitive effort/control
control_proxy = normalize(pupil_dilation)

# Pupil variability = uncertainty
uncertainty_proxy = normalize(pupil_variability)
```

**Cost:** Eye tracker (~$5K), no task changes needed

---

#### **Option C: Brief Questionnaire**

```python
# After each block, ask:
# "How uncertain did you feel about the rules in this block?"
# Scale: 1 (very certain) to 7 (very uncertain)

block_uncertainty = questionnaire_response

# Apply to all trials in block
data.loc[data['block'] == block_id, 'uncertainty_proxy'] = block_uncertainty
```

**Cost:** ~30 seconds per block

---

## Example: Working with Existing Stroop Dataset

### **Typical Stroop Dataset Has:**
- ✅ RT (reaction time)
- ✅ Accuracy (correct/incorrect)
- ✅ Condition (congruent/incongruent)
- ✅ Subject ID
- ❌ Control (not measured)
- ❌ Uncertainty (not measured)

### **What You Can Do:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from models.traditional_evc import TraditionalEVC
from models.bayesian_evc import BayesianEVC
from models.hgf_uncertainty import HGFSequentialEstimator

# Load Stroop data
data = pd.read_csv('stroop_data.csv')

# 1. Create control proxy from RT
# (Slower RT = more control in Stroop)
data['control_proxy'] = normalize(data['rt'])

# 2. Infer uncertainty using HGF
hgf = HGFSequentialEstimator()
data = hgf.process_subject_data(
    data,
    subject_col='subject_id',
    outcome_col='accuracy'
)

# 3. Define reward (correct = rewarded)
data['reward'] = data['accuracy']

# 4. Fit Traditional EVC
trad_model = TraditionalEVC()
trad_results = trad_model.fit(
    data,
    observed_control_col='control_proxy',
    reward_col='reward',
    accuracy_col='accuracy'
)

# 5. Fit Bayesian EVC
bayes_model = BayesianEVC()
bayes_results = bayes_model.fit(
    data,
    observed_control_col='control_proxy',
    reward_col='reward',
    accuracy_col='accuracy',
    uncertainty_col='state_uncertainty',  # From HGF
    confidence_col='confidence'  # From HGF (1 - uncertainty)
)

# 6. Compare
print(f"Traditional R²: {trad_results['r2']:.3f}")
print(f"Bayesian R²: {bayes_results['r2']:.3f}")
print(f"Uncertainty weight: {bayes_results['uncertainty_weight']:.3f}")

if bayes_results['r2'] > trad_results['r2']:
    print("✓ Uncertainty improves control prediction!")
```

**Result:** Publishable analysis using existing data!

## Bottom Line

### **Can you test your theory without new data collection?**

**YES!** With caveats:

✅ **Use proxies** for missing variables (RT, confidence, HGF)
✅ **Re-analyze existing datasets** (OpenNeuro, OSF)
✅ **Meta-analyze** multiple datasets
✅ **Start with proof-of-concept**, then collect ideal data

### **When you NEED new data collection:**

❌ No existing datasets in your domain
❌ Proxies are too noisy/invalid
❌ Want gold-standard validation
❌ Need to manipulate uncertainty experimentally

### **Recommended Path:**

```
Phase 1: Proof of concept with existing data + proxies
         ↓ (Publish in computational journal)
Phase 2: Minimal data collection (add confidence ratings)
         ↓ (Publish in cognitive journal)
Phase 3: Full study with fMRI and designed task
         ↓ (Publish in Nature Neuroscience)
```

**You can make progress at EVERY phase!** 🎯
